# 30 Minute Film Festival: Forgiveness

## Project Name
30 Minute Film Festival: Forgiveness

## Project Description
This project is an interactive website developed for a film festival event. The website is designed to debut a short film titled "Forgiveness", which tells the moving story of two childhood friends—Isaac and Mustafa—who are estranged by a long-standing feud. When a lost wallet reunites them, they confront their differences and rediscover the power of compassion.

The overall concept and theme of the site are centered on forgiveness, reconciliation, and the transformative power of empathy. The experience is enhanced by interactive elements such as a responsive video player, dynamic like/dislike counters, a subscribe button, a comment section, and a search functionality that allows users to easily navigate the content. The design employs a clean, modern layout with a consistent red, white, and black color scheme to evoke the feel of a film festival.

## Process

### Design & Wireframing
The project began with a detailed wireframe. The goal was to create a clear, responsive design with a left-side main video area (for film playback, description, and film info) and a right-side sidebar (for search and video listings).

### Implementation
- **HTML:** Structured the website using semantic elements to define the header, main content, and footer.
- **CSS:** Developed a responsive design using Flexbox to maintain a side-by-side layout, including a 16:9 video container to ensure proper aspect ratio. The color scheme and typography were chosen to complement the film festival aesthetic.
- **JavaScript:** Added interactivity with features such as:
  - Video playback control (updating the main video, title, and description dynamically).
  - Like/Dislike counters that update on button clicks.
  - A subscribe button that changes state upon clicking.
  - A comment section that allows users to post feedback.
  - A search function that highlights and reorders video listings based on user input.

### Testing & Iteration
Through iterative testing, adjustments were made to ensure that the website was fully responsive, user-friendly, and functionally robust. Challenges such as maintaining the correct video aspect ratio and implementing a dynamic search were successfully overcome.

## Reflection/Evaluation

During the development of "30 Minute Film Festival: Forgiveness," I encountered challenges that pushed my technical and creative skills to new heights. Transforming the initial concept into a fully interactive website required careful planning and iterative testing. I successfully implemented a responsive layout using Flexbox and ensured that all interactive elements—such as the like/dislike counters, subscribe button, comment section, and search functionality—worked seamlessly. This process not only deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also reinforced the importance of maintaining clean, well-organized code to achieve a robust and engaging user experience.

Looking back, I am very satisfied with how the project turned out. The final website effectively showcases the film "Forgiveness" by blending storytelling with interactive design elements that resonate with the theme of reconciliation and empathy. The site’s clear navigation and immersive features successfully capture the spirit of a film festival, providing users with both an informative and emotionally engaging experience. Although there is always room for further enhancement, this project has met my expectations and stands as a testament to my growth as a web developer and creative storyteller.
